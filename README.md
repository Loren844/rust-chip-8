# rust-chip-8
A Chip-8 emulator in rust

## Specificities 
- ðŸš« The `0NNN` instruction is not implemented because it executes machine code specific to the original CHIP-8 processors (COSMAC VIP, ETI-660), which is irrelevant for a modern emulator.

## Missing features
- For the moment, the original COSMAC VIP mode is not available but it will be in a next release !
